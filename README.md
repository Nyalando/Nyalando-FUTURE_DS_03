# Titanic Data Analysis and Visualization

## Introduction

This project is an analysis of the famous Titanic dataset using Python. The goal is to explore the data, clean it, and generate valuable insights using statistical techniques and visualizations.


## Project Overview/Steps

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, transforming data types, and preparing data for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis: Identifying trends and relationships in the data through visualizations.
- Feature engineering: Transforming the variables and selecting those that are relevant for modeling.
- Data Visualization: Generating histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices to understand the data better.
- Machine Learning: implemeting decision Trees classification model to predict survival outcomes

## Project Insights
   - Analyzed how various features such as age, gender, and ticket class influence chances of survival.
   - Key factors such as Passenger class, and gender had a significant effect on survival.
   - Built and evaluated a decision model achieving an accuracy of ~ 78%.
   - The next step is to perform hyperparameter tuning to improve on model accuracy.
